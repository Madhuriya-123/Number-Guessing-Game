This is a simple and fun command-line number guessing game built with Python. The game challenges you to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing hints along the way.

# 🚀 Features
Random Number Generation: The game picks a secret number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Interactive Gameplay: Prompts the user for guesses and provides immediate feedback.

Hints: Tells you if your guess is too high or too low.

Attempt Counter: Keeps track of how many guesses it took you to find the number.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles non-numeric input.

🎮 How to Play
Clone the Repository (or copy the code):
If this were a GitHub repository, you'd clone it:

cd number-guessing-game

Since you have the code directly, save it as a Python file (e.g., guess_game.py).

Run the Game:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:

python guess_game.py

Start Guessing!
Follow the on-screen prompts. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low until you find the secret number.
